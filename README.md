# gone loopin'

gone loopin' is a game made in godot for gmtk game jam 2025 with theme loop :) it was made in 4 days.

in gone loopin', you can cast out your rope and slowly loop in the fish to catch them and earn points. catching multiple fish at the same time can give you extra bonuses!

i've always wanted to experiment with 3d games & this is my first attempt at doing one. it was so so fun even though i struggled a lot with the math (the rope uses verlet integration and strange angles) and then submission took a while because i was using a different renderer so it looked different on web. in the end it worked out though & i'm really happy with it <3
